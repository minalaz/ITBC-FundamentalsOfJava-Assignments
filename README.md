# ITBC-FundamentalsOfJava-Assignments
Java Assignments for homework on IT Bootcamp QA course

Assignment9:

- Task1: Create a main method (public static void main...) enter your first and last name (separately) and year of birth via Scanner, print your first and last name and how old you are.
  
- Task2: Do the conversion from Celsius to Fahrenheit. The user enters the temperature for Celsius in an integer value via Scanner and the program prints both in the format "31C = 87.8F", round Fahrenheit to one decimal place.

Assignment10 (IF/ELSE IF/ELSE/SWITCH) :
- Task1:1. Enter the year via Scanner, the program should calculate whether the year is a leap year.
  
- Task2: Create variables "username" and "password" and define some values as desired. The user enters two values via Scanner that should represent username and password and the program should compare them. If the username and password are correct, print "You have successfully logged in", and if one of the two is wrong print the same message "Wrong username or password".

- Task3: Write a program where the user enters the day and month of birth and the program returns what is the zodiac sign.

Assignment11 (FOR/WHILE/DO WHILE loops):

- Task1: Write a FOR loop that goes from 0 to 1000 and displays all numbers divisible by 3.

- Task2: Using a WHILE loop, the user continuously enters numbers and they are added. When the user enters 0, the program prints the sum of the previously entered numbers and the program ends.

- Task3: With a DO WHILE loop, do the sum of the numbers that the user enters. At least one number must be entered (which do while already provides). The program prints what is the sum when you enter 0 or a negative number

Assignment12 (Arrays) :

- Task1: Create an array of 5 elements and print the first element (Choose the type yourself).

- Task2: Create an array of arbitrary length of integer values and multiply the last element by the total number of elements (Use .length, not a fixed value).

- Task3: Create two arrays and show which array has more elements (You don't have to use a loop but you can use an if statement).

Assignment13 (Methods):

- Task1: Make a method that returns a boolean type and accepts two integers as parameters. The method returns true only if those two integers are one after another, for example 16 17 or 24 25. In the main method print with println a few examples to test (4-5 calls is enough).
  
- Task2: Make a method that prints text and accepts two Strings as parameters. The printout is in the following format: "Name: " text1 " Surname: " text 2. text1 should be all uppercase, while text2 should be all lowercase. In the main method call a few examples to test (2-3 calls is enough).

Assignment14 (Methods):

- Task1: Make a method that prints an array and accepts an array as parameters. Inside the method find the largest value in the array, and then set that value as the value of each element in the array. Use Scanner to fill in the initial array. (Call the method 3-4 times).

- Task2: Make a method that does currency conversion. The currencies used are EUR, USD, GBP. Write conversions using switch, by checking which currency the user entered as a parameter, and return (return) in that new currency the calculated value. In main, the user enters via Scanner the number of dinars he wants to convert to some currency, and the currency itself as a string. Print a few examples of calls in main. Currencies are double values and you can take them from the NBS website. (3-4 calls enough).
